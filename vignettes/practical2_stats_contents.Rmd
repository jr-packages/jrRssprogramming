In this question, we are going to use a `for` statement to
loop} over the game of thrones data set and construct some scatter plots. To generate the data, run the following piece of R code

```{r echo=TRUE}
data(GoTRating, package = "jrRssprogramming")
head(GoTRating)
``` 

The data represents tv ratings for the first 6 seasons of the popular tv series, Game of Thrones. We want to create a
scatter plot of Rating against Episode, for each Season.

1. First we create a scatter plot of one treatment:

    ```{r F1, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.keep="none"}
    library(dplyr)
    s_1 = filter(GoTRating, Season == 1)
    plot(s_1$Episode, s_1$Rating)
    ``` 
   
 
1. To generate a scatter-plot for each treatment, we need to iterate over the different
treatment types:

    ```{r results='hide', fig.keep='none', tidy=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
    for(i in unique(GoTRating$Season)) {
      group = filter(GoTRating, Season == i)
      plot(group$Episode, group$Rating)
      readline("Hit return for next plot")
    }
    ``` 
    * What does `unique(GoTRating$Season)` give?
        ```{r}
        ## It gives all Seasons.
        ```
    * In the `for` loop, what variable is changing? What are it's possible values?
        ```{r}
        ## The Season variable is changing. 
        ## It goes through the different Seasons.
        ```
    * What does the `readline()` function do?
        
        ```{r}
        ## It halts execution, waits for user input
        ```


## Questions

1. The default axis labels aren't great. So we can change the $x$-axis label using `xlab`:
```{r fig.keep='none', tidy=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
plot(group$Episode, group$Rating, xlab="Episode")
```
```{r, fig.keep="none"}
plot(group$Episode, group$Rating,
     xlab="Episode", ylab="Rating")
```
Use the `ylab` argument to alter the $y$-axis label.

2. To add a title to a plot we use the `main` argument, viz:

```{r F2, tidy=FALSE, fig.keep="none", echo = TRUE}
     plot(group$Episode, group$Rating, 
      main="Season", xlab="Episode")
```

We can combine strings/characters using the `paste()` function,

```{r , echo = TRUE}
    paste("Season", i)
```
Rather than have a static title, make the title of each plot display the season number.

```{r fig.keep='none', tidy=FALSE}
     plot(group$Episode, group$Rating, main = paste("Season", i),
      xlab = "Episode", ylab = "Rating")
``` 

3. The y-axis range should really be the same in all graphics. Add a `ylim` argument to fix the range. __Hint__: Work out the range before the `for` loop.

    ```{r  fig.keep='none', tidy=FALSE}
    range(GoTRating$Rating)
    plot(group$Episode, group$Rating, 
      main=paste("Season", i), xlab="Episode", ylab="Rating",
      ylim=c(0, 10))
    ``` 


4. For each season, plot a linear regression line with Rating as our response variable and Episode as our covariate. This should still all be within the for loop! __Hint__: use `lm()` then `abline()`

```{r fig.keep='none', message=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
plot(group$Episode, group$Rating,
ylab = "Rating", xlab="Episode",
main=paste("Season", i))

## fit the model
fit = lm(Rating ~ Episode, data = group)
abline(fit, col = "red", lty = 2)
```
  
5. At each iteration, use the `message()` function to print the p-value for the Episode covariate and the Adjusted R-squared for each model. __Hint__: Use the `summary()` function

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE}
sfit = summary(fit)
p = sfit$coefficients[,4][2]
message("p = ", p)
message("The adj R squared is: ", sfit$adj.r.squared)
```

6. Judging by the adjusted R squared and the covariate p-value, which seasons of Game of Thrones is this model best fitted for?

7. Add each covariate p-value to it's repsective graph using the `text()` function. This requires x and y coordinates for the text. For instance,

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
text(1, 2, "Hello")
```

would add the text "hello" the the point x = 1, y = 2. 

```{r message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
text(5, 9, paste("p =", p))
```
     
8. Suppose we wanted to save individual graphs in a pdf file. Add the `pdf()`
function to your code save the resulting graph. To get unique file names, use the paste
command:

```{r}
filename = paste0("Season", i, ".pdf")
```

9. Put your code, i.e. the `for` loop and plotting commands (not the message commands), in a function which takes the data frame as an argument.
